# Work-Day-Scheduler
A calendar app that functions to let users save events in a calendar format.

## Description

This website should be used to store events in a users workday. The scheduler displays what day it is, highlights the hour that is current and has different formatting for prior hours to help the user know what events are upcoming or have passed. The user can save their events and they will be saved to local storage so that if they close or refresh the broswer their events are still saved.
